# Kaleidoscope App

## Overview
The Kaleidoscope App is a visually engaging Pygame application that features dynamic animations within a fullscreen square. The app demonstrates continuous horizontal and vertical line animations that wrap around like the classic "snake" game, providing a soothing visual experience.

## Features
- **Single Fullscreen Square**: The application displays a single square that fills the entire window
- **Red Borders**: The square is outlined with red borders for visual clarity  
- **Horizontal Line Animation**: A long horizontal line animates continuously from left to right, wrapping from the right side back to the left
- **Vertical Line Animation**: A long vertical line animates continuously from top to bottom, wrapping from the bottom back to the top
- **Smooth Animation**: Both animations are synchronized and confined within the bounds of the square

## Usage
The app will launch a window displaying the kaleidoscope animation. Any changes made to the code will automatically restart the application due to the watchdog functionality.

## Controls
- Close the application by clicking the close button on the window
